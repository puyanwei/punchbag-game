This is a repo for learning vue.js via the [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LYrN_cAJoA&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQcYgjhBoeQH7wiAyZNrYa) by Net Ninja.

This game is created from [tutorial #13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjfpQlVem-8), and then worked on furthermore adding a 60's style batman random word generator, sounds, and styling.
